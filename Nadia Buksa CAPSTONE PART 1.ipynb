    "**<center>Predict the number of days required to satisfy a service request.</center>**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why is it important?**<br>\n",
    "We will find out shortly that the number of days required to satisfy a request may vary from a few days to a few years. There seem to be no clear patterns that would determine these metrics. As a resident or a visitor calling for service, this kind of delay may be highly frustrating. As per NOLA-311's mission statement, they highly value customer service.\n",

    "1. Enhancement of customer satisfaction through setting accurate expectations.\n",

Conclusion: will leave both columns, and need to condense and/or clean categories in `Request Reason`, then come back and compare the two categories again. `Request Reason` contains 121 categories. One option is to cut the tail of bottom 5% categories that contain less that N number of instances and place them in a generic column ('other'). A more tidy process would require going through 121 categories and trying to organize them into broader groups.

    "3. Removed `Contractor Action` and `Contractor` as 99.86% and 91.16% (word) contained no information in it.\n",
    "4. Confirmed that `Status` and `Request Status` are not duplicates. However, only a sample fraction of `Status` contains more informative categories, and the rest of it mirrors `Request Status`.\n",
    "4. Revealed that `Request Type` and `Request Reason` contain different, but very similar categories. Explored `Request Reason` and left unchanged. Condensed `Request Type`'s categories.\n",

Judging by the size of the data set, it may hold all the records from 2012-2018, and for some reason after the merge, `Date Created` got corrupted for all existing cases at the time. Testing this assumption is one of the three options I have at this point:\n",

    "It does look like these two columns are interchangeable, but `request_type` has less than 1% of nulls, while in`issue_type_old` nulls make almost 50% of the values. It would be preferable to keep only one column and avoid unnecessary data cleaning if possible. But before I conclude that `issue_type_old` can be removed, I would like to see if `request_type` makes sense when it comes to its categories' connection specific `responsible_agency`. Ideally, I would like to see distinct boundaries between areas of responsibility for each Agency. It would not be preferable if one category splits between two agencies or more. "

Additionally, it would not make a lot of sense trying to replace these values, because it looks mostly like resident's comments on their requests. \n",
